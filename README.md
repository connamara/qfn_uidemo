== DO NOT USE THIS PROJECT ==

**No support or advice will be given to people who use this project.**

This project was never intended to help anyone learn QF/n.
That's what [the official examples](https://github.com/connamara/quickfixn/tree/master/Examples) are for.

This project was an experiment.  **It is not a good example of a QF/n app.**

I [once wrote](http://lists.quickfixn.com/pipermail/quickfixn-quickfixn.com/2017q4/000575.html) about this project:
